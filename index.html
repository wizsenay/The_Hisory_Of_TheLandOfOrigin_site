                <h1>ETHIOPIA</h1>
                <p>Ethiopia, often referred to as the "Cradle of Humankind," holds a profound place in the story of our species. It was here that the world-renowned fossil "Lucy" (Australopithecus afarensis), estimated to be over 3 million years old, was discovered — offering vital clues about early human evolution. With a history stretching back thousands of years, Ethiopia is one of the few African countries never colonized, preserving a distinct culture, alphabet, and calendar. Its ancient kingdoms, such as Axum, played a major role in global trade and the spread of Christianity long before many Western nations adopted the faith.</p>
                <p>Beyond its historical and archaeological significance, Ethiopia continues to impact the world in everyday ways. Most famously, it is the birthplace of coffee — a gift that has transformed global cultures and routines. Legend tells of a goat herder named Kaldi who noticed his goats becoming energetic after eating red berries from a certain tree, giving rise to what would become a worldwide obsession. Ethiopia is also a land of vibrant traditions, colorful festivals, and a landscape that ranges from rugged highlands to the otherworldly Danakil Depression. As both an ancient and modern marvel, Ethiopia offers a legacy that bridges the origins of humankind with cultural treasures that continue to influence the world today.</p>

                    <p>Ethiopia’s history is as vast and majestic as its landscapes. Known as one of the oldest nations in the world, Ethiopia has been home to powerful kingdoms, remarkable civilizations, and deep-rooted traditions that span thousands of years. From the ancient Axumite Empire and the rock-hewn churches of Lalibela, to its heroic stand against colonialism, Ethiopia’s story is one of resilience, pride, and rich cultural heritage. As the only African country never colonized, Ethiopia has preserved its unique identity — from its own alphabet and calendar to being the birthplace of coffee and one of the earliest adopters of Christianity. Journey through the timeline of a nation that truly stands as the heart of African history.</p>
