                <h1>ETHIOPIA</h1>
                <p>Ethiopia, often referred to as the "Cradle of Humankind," holds a profound place in the story of our species. It was here that the world-renowned fossil "Lucy" (Australopithecus afarensis), estimated to be over 3 million years old, was discovered — offering vital clues about early human evolution. With a history stretching back thousands of years, Ethiopia is one of the few African countries never colonized, preserving a distinct culture, alphabet, and calendar. Its ancient kingdoms, such as Axum, played a major role in global trade and the spread of Christianity long before many Western nations adopted the faith.</p>
                <p>Beyond its historical and archaeological significance, Ethiopia continues to impact the world in everyday ways. Most famously, it is the birthplace of coffee — a gift that has transformed global cultures and routines. Legend tells of a goat herder named Kaldi who noticed his goats becoming energetic after eating red berries from a certain tree, giving rise to what would become a worldwide obsession. Ethiopia is also a land of vibrant traditions, colorful festivals, and a landscape that ranges from rugged highlands to the otherworldly Danakil Depression. As both an ancient and modern marvel, Ethiopia offers a legacy that bridges the origins of humankind with cultural treasures that continue to influence the world today.</p>
