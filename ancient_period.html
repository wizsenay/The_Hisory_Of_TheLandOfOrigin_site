One of Ham's sons is Cush, who is the father of Ethiopia, known as Ethiopis. The Kushites who came from Mesopotamia also settled in the highlands of Ethiopia. "About 100 years ago, the Queen of Egypt, Hatshepseth, sent ships across the Red Sea to trade with the Ethiopians living in the Red Sea area. "The Egyptians brought grain! Glass 1 plate and other things. In exchange, they brought ivory: utensils | Spices, gold and various local items from Ethiopia.

These are the Semites Because they were more advanced than the Kushites in terms of civilization, they passed on their language and culture to the Kushites, so their civilization was known as the Sabaeans. This made a great change in ancient Ethiopia. Another tribe named Agazi got the name Geez, which is an ancient Ethiopian language.</P>
                        <p>As soon as the kingdom of Axum became powerful, it became famous for trading with other countries. One of the things he wanted was African elephants for his army. The sailors started trading with the Ethiopians in Bernice's Al Golden Tin. Greek captains came driving Ptolemy's ships to visit Ethiopia and trade with it. The first leaders were Europeans.</p>

At Axum they were made in a strange manner, perhaps for the sun; They are great stone statues that were built as a place of moon worship. Their construction is not stone on top of stone, but they are carved out of a single rock in a thin and long shape. "The longest of all was more than 33 meters high.

Some of the kings and the people worshiped Greek gods." The writings were written by the Sabaeans and the Greeks about the ancient kings of Ethiopia.</p>
                        <p>The oldest known text about the Kingdom of Axum was the book "The Sea of ​​Eritrea" which was written by a merchant who came to Adulis around the end of the first century.</p>
                        <p>Next, another merchant named Cosmos wrote a book called The Christian Topography. When he was in Adulis, he copied two ancient books for the governor. Then one of them was in Ach, who was the king of Axum came to Adulis many years ago to praise the Greek gods. In this text, the king wrote about his conquest and possession of many countries.

                        <p>Next was Caleb, the strong king of Ethiopia. He led the people of Axum wisely and gave good governance. During Caleb's reign, Jesus Tienius of Rome sent his ambassador to Ethiopia. At this time, the Roman king was at war with the Persian king over the trade route from India to Europe. Therefore, he thought that the Emperor of Ethiopia would help me by importing this trade of silk and spices from India through the Red Sea to Europe. King Caleb promised to help him</p> 
                        <p>As King Caleb was a Christian, he helped the Christians in Yemen. At that time, the Jewish religion was strong in Arab countries, so a Jewish king tried to kill all the Christians. Therefore, King Caleb said it would be better if Yemen were governed by Ethiopians as in the past. And in 518 AD. m. He sent a great army to Yemen and defeated him, and the king appointed a Christian ruler there. Then a rebellion broke out and the people of Yemen made their own king. Although King Caleb Dagh sent his army and did not win, in the end, the king of Ethiopia allowed another king of Yemen to send tribute to the king of Ethiopia.</p>

He built a great church in Sanaa where many people come to worship. In the Arab country, they tried to destroy the stone image (Baba) that the pagans worshiped in Mecca. King Abraha was heading towards Mecca with his spear. But in the history of the late Arabs, this time was called the year of the elephant. Muhammad was born in the same year and was enough to establish the religion called Islam; This is the reason why Ethiopia's history changed its shape again.</p>

                        <p>Although the Muslims know that Ethiopia is a Christian country, they did not do the same (holy war) on Ethiopia as they did on the Near East and North Africa; As their army grew stronger, the Islamists conquered many countries, including Egypt.</p>
                        <p>During this era of Islamic expansion (in the 700th year), the Ethiopians continued to trade on the Red Sea. There was once a war between the ships of the countries living in the Red Sea area. Ethiopians in 635 AD. They passed through the Arabian coast and burned the jinn; Apart from this angering the Arabs, they were also afraid that Mecca would be captured by the Ethiopians. The caliphs who ruled the Arabs sent their armies and took the Ethiopian Red Sea Islands. By attacking the sea gates, they made the Adulis sea gate useless and prevented its name from being revived. It became necessary to obtain permission from the Arabs before entering and exiting the Red Sea. At this time, Ethiopia had often difficult roads for the pilgrims to Sudan and Egypt.</p>
                        <p>Axum and northern highlands of Ethiopia were completely cut off from the rest of the world. European Christians also had a lot of difficulty in reaching Ethiopia; Ethiopia from Egypt; from Greece; She was hampered by the civilizational assistance she received from Rome and other peoples. Usually, foreigners entered Ethiopia only when a new bishop was sent from the Patriarch of Alexandria. Even if the previous bishop died, he would often ask for another one to arrive.</p>
                        <p>Ethiopia continued to develop its own civilization by being alone at the point of total disconnection from the world. When the ports of the Red Sea were destroyed, she became interested in the southern provinces of Aksum. Christians wanted to teach the gospel to the pagans in the south. In the same way, the king and the churches sent the messengers of the gospel to Gonder. Gojam and Shaw sent separate units. These countries gradually became parts of Christian Ethiopia.</p>
                        <p>In 899. About Ethiopia had a brave king who defeated the Arabs. He restored the shores of Ethiopia; He freed the ports of the Red Sea from the leaders of Islam; Again, Ethiopia began its border with the Red Sea and Yemen; She built another new port in Zeylam</p>
                        <p>In 1998 m. Another problem arose; About this problem (the history of the Archbishops of Alexandria) is written in the fifth book. A pagan queen stabbed the king of Ethiopia and killed many Christians, so while the Christians of Ethiopia were in danger, the king asked the Sudanese (King George) to help him import a new bishop from Alexandria, and the patriarch sent the new bishop. The queen and her army were defeated; However, because Ethiopia was damaged in the war, the Islamists in the southeast established a powerful government in Somalia and were able to take the port of Zeila from Ethiopia.</p>
