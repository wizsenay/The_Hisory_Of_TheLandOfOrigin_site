                <h1>Zagwe Kingdom</h1>
                <p>In 1 thousand 143 AD. A new line of kings took power in Ethiopia. King Tatu was a Christian. But they did not make the offer at Axum, but at Lalibela in Lasta. The people cried out; It was called the line of kings. The greatest of the kings of Zaguye was King Lalibala, and his greatest work was building churches.

                <h2>Lalibela</h2>
                <p>The city of Lalibela is an amazing place nestled high in the mountains. Nowhere else in Africa, except in very few places on other continents, is the type of Lalibela church building found. It is not a stone on top of a stone, but the roof is carved from the earth to the bottom of a rock. When this is done, a wide area is chosen first; Then a trench is dug around it and a big rock is left in the middle. Next, it will be completely hollowed out until the stone columns that seem to hold the roof are left.</p>
                <p>Among the buildings built in this way, medhani'alem church is the biggest one, which the length is 33, the side is 22 and the height is 11 meters. And 28 columns have inside of it. Mary's next to him; The Golgotha ​​Church, where Michael, as well as the Giorgis Church, which was built in the shape of a Greek cross, can be seen in a beautiful way.</p>
                <p>There were few articles written about Ethiopia during this period. For the time being, they were the authority of the Patriarch of Alexandria for the Ethiopian Church.

Once, the patriarch sent an Egyptian bi</p>
                <p>The kings of Zaguye wanted to find some holy places in Jerusalem and Bethlehem, and with permission, some places were given to the Ethiopian Church (Holy Place) in Jerusalem and Bethlehem.</p>
                <p>During the reign of the Zaguye kings, it was a time of confusion because of the problems at home and abroad. The Muslims cut off the rest of the foreign communication except through Sudan and Egypt. In the interior, Zaguye kings moved the throne from Aksum to Lalibela and concluded the kingdom of Aksum. Eventually, the Zaguye kings weakened and their territories became smaller and smaller.</p>
